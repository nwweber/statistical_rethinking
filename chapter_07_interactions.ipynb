McElreath: Lin. model in previous chapters cannot capture this. **again seems to indicate that we cannot use interpretation of 'given all other factors, how much do we learn about milk energy by getting information about brain size'. because 'all other factors' would include 'kind of primate'. which is weird, because is this not what 'statistically controlling for' would imply? we put in the another predictor into the model and thus control for it. more questions, not more answers. need discussion.**\n",
